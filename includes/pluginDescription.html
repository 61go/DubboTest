<h3>DubboTest can directly request your dubbo interface, and hope to bring you some convenience
    when developing and
    debugging.</h3>

<h3>Quick start:</h3>

<p>1.First, you need to start the dubbo service first to expose your interface</p>
<p>2.Find the interface method you need to debug, right-click and select RunDubboTest, then you can see the DubboTest
    window pops up, and some parameters are randomly generated, you can change your input parameters. After the
    parameters are determined, click the run button.</p>

<h3>The address input box can choose the following two types.</h3>
<p>use zookeeper: zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181</p>
<p>use dubbo: dubbo://127.0.0.1:2288</p>

<h3><em>tips:</em></h3>
<p><em>1.The methodType field needs to correspond to the input parameter type of your interface,
    and generally does not need to be changed, because it will be automatically generated
    for you after you right-click and select it. When your input parameter is not a regular object,
    you need to add a class field to tell dubbo which class you are using.</em></p>
<p><em>2.There is a save button behind the input box了‘, you can choose to save the current address for
    selection next time, or you can click the delete button to delete the current address</em></p>
